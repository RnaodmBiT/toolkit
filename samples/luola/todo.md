# TODO: Luola
Remove the elements from this list as they are implemented.

## Things that need doing

- User Interface - In Progress
  
  The main menu has been implemented. Now The options page needs to be filled out. This would also mean saving the game options to a file, probably a JSON file. The join and host pages have player names and remote address entry. The host page should have game options as they become available and the join page should get some form of server memory or lists.

- Game Lobby

  Some form of connecting into a game lobby, picking teams and game types/level? then finally starting the game.

- Weapons

  Need to figure out how to make cool unique weapons.

- Teams //Started

  Ships need to have different colours. It would also be sweet to see names over ships

- Controls //Finished

  Players should be able to toggle between keyboard/mouse aiming

- Camera //Started

  A proper game camera needs to be implemented. I imagine a camera that focuses ahead of the players ship based on speed and direction.
