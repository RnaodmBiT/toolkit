# TODO: Luola
Remove the elements from this list as they are implemented.

## Things that need doing

- User Interface

  This would be some kind of menu type thing. I have envisioned a list of buttons (Host, Join, Options, Quit) on the bottom left and these pop out windows/panels with all the appropriate options on them.

- Game Lobby

  Some form of connecting into a game lobby, picking teams and game types/level? then finally starting the game.

- Weapons

  Need to figure out how to make cool unique weapons.

- Teams //Started

  Ships need to have different colours. It would also be sweet to see names over ships

- Controls

  Players should be able to toggle between keyboard/mouse aiming

- Camera //Started

  A proper game camera needs to be implemented. I imagine a camera that focuses ahead of the players ship based on speed and direction.
